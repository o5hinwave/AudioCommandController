## ❌ **WHAT DOESN'T WORK (On Purpose):**

### **1. Microphone Input**
- ❌ **Does NOT work:** Speaking into microphone
- ✅ **Does work:** TYPING commands in text box
- **Why:** Streamlit Cloud doesn't support browser microphone API by default

### **2. Real Stem Separation**
- ❌ **Does NOT work:** Actual audio processing
- ✅ **Does work:** UI interface, progress bars, buttons
- **Why:** Demo mode - real processing needs heavy ML models (4GB+ RAM)

### **3. Hardware MIDI Output**
- ❌ **Does NOT work:** Sending to physical MIDI devices
- ✅ **Does work:** Simulated MIDI logging
- **Why:** Browser can't access system MIDI ports without Web MIDI API

### **4. Real Audio Analysis (Phonic Mind)**
- ❌ **Does NOT work:** Analyzing real audio files
- ✅ **Does work:** Shows sample analysis data
- **Why:** Demo mode - real analysis needs ML models

## 🔍 **TROUBLESHOOTING:**

### **Problem: "Page won't load"**

```bash
# Check if Streamlit is running:
ps aux | grep streamlit

# If not running, start it:
streamlit run streamlit_app.py
```

### **Problem: "I see blank page"**

1. Clear browser cache (Ctrl+Shift+Delete)
2. Try different browser (Chrome recommended)
3. Disable ad blockers
4. Hard refresh (Ctrl+F5)

### **Problem: "Voice commands don't work"**

**Are you TYPING or SPEAKING?**
- ❌ Speaking into mic → Won't work
- ✅ Typing in text box → Will work

**Example:**
```
1. Find text box that says "Enter voice command"
2. TYPE: solo track 3
3. Click "🎤 Process" button
4. Should show green success message
```

### **Problem: "Faders don't move"**

**Are you clicking and dragging?**
```
1. Click on the slider
2. Hold mouse button down
3. Drag up (increase) or down (decrease)
4. Release mouse button
5. Number should change below slider
```

### **Problem: "No sound from stem separation"**

**This is expected!**
- Stem separation is **UI DEMO** only
- Shows interface but doesn't process audio
- To add real processing, need to install:
  - Spleeter or Demucs
  - Add processing code
  - Deploy on server with GPU
